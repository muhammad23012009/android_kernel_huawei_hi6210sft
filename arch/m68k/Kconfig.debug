          Write kernel log output directly to a serial port.

          This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
          early before the console code is initialized.

	bool "Early printk"
	depends on !(SUN3 || M68000 || COLDFIRE)
	help
          Write kernel log output directly to a serial port.
          Where implemented, output goes to the framebuffer as well.
          PROM console functionality on Sun 3x is not affected by this option.

          Pass "earlyprintk" on the kernel command line to get a
          boot console.

          This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
          early, i.e. before the normal console driver is loaded.

          You should normally say N here, unless you want to debug such a crash.
