	  Renesas USBHS is a discrete USB host and peripheral controller chip
	  that supports both full and high speed USB 2.0 data transfers.
	  It has nine or more configurable endpoints, and endpoint zero.

	  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	  dynamically linked module called "renesas_usbhs"
